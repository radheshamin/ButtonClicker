# ButtonClicker
sample application for cs4261
The app gives you the user a pattern to copy and expects them to press the buttons in the correct order to win. 
If they press an incorrect button, it gives you a new pattern but continues the time. 
If they finish the pattern correctly, they can check your time on the screen and then press any of the buttons to try again.
