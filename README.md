# ButtonClicker
This is a sample application for CS4261.
The app gives you the user a pattern to copy and expects them to press the buttons in the correct order to win. 
If they press an incorrect button, it gives you a new pattern but continues the time. 
If they finish the pattern correctly, they can check your time on the screen and then press any of the buttons to try again.

To run the application, download the code. Please install npm and node.js. In a terminal, navigate to the downloaded code and run the three following commands:

npm install -g expo-cli

expo install firebase .

expo start

These will install the needed packages and start a development server.
